        <p>Hey! I'm Dat Nguyen. I'm a senior-year college undergraduate who is going to be earning their B.S. in computer science. I was originally a neuroscience major on the premed track, but then I decided to switch my major to computer science. It definitely sucked at first, but after putting countless hours and effort into learning how to code, I came to enjoy it much more! This year, I dropped off the premed track since I really couldn't see myself doing anything other than developing software. Outside of coding, my favorite thing to do is powerlift. I've also been playing a lot of super smash bros as I just got a switch. </p>

        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>(July 2021) <a href="https://github.com/DatN99/FitnessTracker" target = "_blank"><strong>Fitness Tracker Android App</strong></a>
                <ul>
                    <li>Getting the best results from weightlifting comes from consistency and precise measurements. I built an Android app using Java for the frontend and html for layouts. The app is structured as one activity with multiple fragments including one nested fragment. The app allows users to track their sets while working out which comes with many features that make adding sets fast and easy. The app also comes with a timer that keeps track of the userâ€™s current rest time between sets, a list of all their past workouts that displays information about each specific workout, and a graph where users can see their overall volume displayed over time.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

        </ul>
